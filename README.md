## Key Improvements over v1

| Feature                        | v1 (Old)                                                                | v2 (New)                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Salary Scheduling**          | Used **BokkyPooBahsDateTimeLibrary** for date calculations (gas-heavy). | Uses a **lightweight 30-day timestamp check**, significantly reducing gas cost. |
| **Contract Size & Complexity** | More bulky, more storage operations.                                    | **Slimmed-down architecture**, fewer dependencies.                              |
| **Efficiency**                 | Required additional date computations.                                  | **Direct timestamp comparisons**, making automation cheaper.                    |
| **Maintainability**            | Harder to extend & audit.                                               | Cleaner, modular design with better event logging.                              |
